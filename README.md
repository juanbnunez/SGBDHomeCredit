# SGBD Home Credit Project

This is a practical database management project that focuses on designing, implementing, and optimizing a real-world database (Home Credit Data Base). The project aims to cover various aspects of database development, including entity-relationship modeling, relational schema design, data insertion functions, triggers, optimization techniques, user roles, and more with SQL Server.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a robust database model for a real-world problem using SQL Server.
- Implement business logic within the DBMS based on a real-life application.
- Interact with the DBMS through various tools to design and develop database objects.
- Ensure normalization, optimization, security, and high availability of the database system.

## Getting Started

   ```

2. **Database Setup:** Execute the SQL scripts provided in the `Database Scripts` directory to create the necessary tables, relationships, functions, triggers, and other database objects.

3. **Application Setup:** Set up the web application that will interact with the database. Ensure that the application connects to the database using the provided credentials.

4. **Documentation:** Refer to the `Documentation` directory for detailed information about the project, including entity-relationship diagrams, relational schema, triggers, optimization strategies, and more.
